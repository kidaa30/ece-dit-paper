\section{Introduction}

	Abstract models for real-time systems often require the determination of the
	(worst-case) computation time of a job (WCET), a value highly dependent on the
	platform on which the application will be deployed.\\

	The \emph{C-space} of a real-time system is, intuitively,
	the set of WCET values for which this system would be feasible. A
	precise and efficient description of its C-space would allow to quickly decide
	if a system is feasible on a given platform.\\

	In this section the current description of the C-space of synchronous
	constrained systems, which has been mostly covered by \cite{george2009characterization}, is reviewed.

	\subsection{Model}

		We consider a discrete timeline and tasks systems $\tau$ comprised of periodic concrete
		tasks with constrained deadlines on uniprocessor platforms. Each task
		$\tau_i$ is represented by a tuple $(O_i, C_i, D_i, T_i)$ where $O_i$ is the offset value,
		$C_i$ the WCET, $D_i$ the relative deadline and $T_i$ the period.
		The constrained deadline property implies that $D_i \leq T_i \; \forall i$. In
		the following, we differentiate between \emph{synchronous systems} (where $O_i
		= 0 \; \forall i$) and \emph{asynchronous systems} (which are not synchronous).\\

		For those systems, the \emph{Earliest Deadline First} (EDF) algorithm, in
		which jobs are prioritized according to their absolute deadline, has been
		shown to be optimal \cite{liu1973scheduling}, which means it
		correctly schedules any feasible system within that group.\\

		Furthermore, the following notations are used:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\tau = \{\tau_0, \cdots, \tau_{n-1}\}$
			\item $H = \operatorname{lcm}(T_0, \cdots, T_{n-1})$
			\item $O_{max} = \max (O_0, \cdots, O_{n-1})$
			\item An \emph{idle time} is an instant $t$ at which each job that arrived
			\emph{strictly} before $t$ has finished its execution.
			\item A \emph{busy period} is a time interval during which there is always
			at least one unfinished job available in the system and maximal
			with this property. Any busy period starts and ends
			with an idle time.
			\item The interval between the initial time and the first
			idle time is called the \emph{first busy period}.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{The DBF feasibility test}

	We recall the necessary and sufficient condition explained in \cite{baruah1999generalized, baruah1990algorithms}, based on the demand-bound function.

	\begin{definition}
		The \textbf{demand-bound function (DBF)}
		defined for a task set $\tau$ and noted $\dbf{t_1, t_2}$, is equal to
		the maximal cumulated execution time of jobs of $\tau$ contained in the
		closed interval $[t_1, t_2]$.
	\end{definition}

	Mathematically,
	\[
		\dbf{t_1, t_2} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} n_i(t_1, t_2) \, C_i
	\]
	where $n_i(t_1, t_2)$ is the number of jobs of task $i$ which arrival times
	and deadlines are both in the closed interval $[t_1, t_2]$.\\

	The values of the $n_i$ are given by
	\[
		n_i(t_1, t_2) =
		\left\llbracket
			\left\lfloor
				\frac{t_2 - O_i - D_i}{T_i}
			\right\rfloor -
			\left\lceil
				\frac{t_1 - O_i}{T_i}
			\right\rceil + 1
		\right\rrbracket_0
	\]
	where $\llbracket x \rrbracket_0$ stands for $\max \{ 0, x \}$.\\

	The DBF allows to give a necessary and sufficient condition of feasibility:

	\begin{theorem}
	\[
		\begin{array}{c}
			\{\tau_1, ..., \tau_n\} \: \text{is feasible}  \iff \\
			\dbf{t_1, t_2} \leq t_2 - t_1 \; \forall \: 0 \leq t_1 \leq t_2
		\end{array}
	\]
	\end{theorem}

	\subsection{C-space of synchronous systems}

		\subsubsection{Definition}

			The authors of \cite{george2009characterization} give the following definition of the C-space:
			\begin{definition}
				For a given task system $\tau$ in which the $C_i$ are not known, the
				\textbf{C-space} is a region of $n$ dimensions (where each dimension denotes
				the possible $C_i$ of a task of $\tau$) such that for any vector $C = \{ C_0, \cdots, C_{n-1}\}$ in the C-space, $\tau$ is feasible.
			\end{definition}

%Thus, with a good description of the C-space, it is easy to check if a given vector of $C_i$ value (given e.g. when deploying the application on a specific platform) allows the system to be scheduled or not.

		\subsubsection{Description using DBF}
			\label{sct:cspaceDescr}

			A region of $\mathbb{N}^n$ can be described by a list of parametric linear
			constraints describing the convex hull of that region. In other words, a
			list of conditions which can unequivocally decide if a point is included in the region or not.\\

			For the synchronous case, the DBF test gives us a list of inequations
			on the WCET values of the task set which together are a necessary and
			sufficient condition of feasibility. They can all be written in the
			following way:
			\[
				\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} n_i(t_1, t_2) \, C_i \leq t_2 - t_1 \; \forall \: 0 \leq
				t_1 \leq t_2
			\]
			Note that for a given $t$, we have that the $n_i(t)$ are
			constant (w.r.t. the $C_i$). Those inequations are thus indeed linear.\\

			However, this description contains an infinite number of constraints, most of
			which are redundant. While this does not harm the precision of the
			test, the smallest description is preferred as it can greatly
			reduce the computation time of practical feasibility tests using this system
			of inequations. In Section~\ref{sct:removeRedundancy} a method to reduce the size of this set of constraints is given.

	\subsection{Removing redundancy}
		\label{sct:removeRedundancy}

	In the synchronous case, is has been shown that the inequations corresponding
	to every interval $[0, t]$ (with $t$ a job deadline happening before $H$) are
	necessary and sufficient to test the feasibility of a system.\\

	Even then, the number of inequations to consider is exponential in the number
	of tasks. While it has been shown that constraints that cover intervals ending
	after the end of the first busy period are also redundant, this value depends on the $C_i$ and is
	therefore not usable, or at least not for the purposes of this paper. The
	following concept is thus introduced, which is similar to the end of the busy period but which does not depend on the execution times.

	\begin{definition}
		A \textbf{definitive idle time} (DIT) is a time $t$ such that every job
		released strictly before instant $t$ has its absolute deadline before or at instant $t$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}
		The earliest DIT occurring in the system strictly after $t=0$ is called the
		\textbf{first DIT} and is noted $t_d$.
	\end{definition}

	The value of the first DIT can be found by solving the following equation:
	\[
		t_d = \min
		\left( t \; s.t. \; \forall i:
			\left\{
				\begin{array}{c}
					t \equiv a_i \; (mod \; T_i) \\
					a_i \in [D_i, T_i]
				\end{array}
			\right.
		\right)
	\]

	\begin{remark} (from the definition):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Contrary to other idle times, DITs are independent of the
			scheduling or the execution times of the jobs.
			\item In a feasible system, every DIT is an idle time.
			\item In a feasible system, the first DIT happens at the end of the
			first busy period.
			\item As $H$ is always a DIT in synchronous systems, we have at least $t_d
			\leqslant H$ in this case.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{remark}

	Every DIT being an idle instant, the execution of the system after a DIT does
	not depend on what happened before. Because the synchronous arrival pattern is
	the worst case [citation needed], it is sufficient for the DBF test to only
	consider intervals $[0, t]$ with $t$ being a deadline before the first DIT.\\

	To summarize, we reduced the description of the C-space from an infinite number
	of constraints to only the inequations where $t_1 = 0$, $t_2 \leqslant t_d$ and
	values of $t_2$ correspond to job deadlines. Note that the number of
	constraints is still exponential in the number of tasks.

	\subsection{Our work}
		In this paper, we extend the work of \cite{george2009characterization} to the
		asynchronous case. In section \ref{sct:asyncDIT}, we present an extension of
		the concept of DIT adapted to the asynchronous case called first periodic DIT
		($t_d$), along with an algorithm to find its value. In Section
		\ref{sct:asyncCspace}, we show how to describe the C-space of an asynchronous
		system based on the DBF test, and we show why the interval $[t_d, t_d + H]$ is
		sufficient to consider.

\section{DIT in asynchronous systems}
	\label{sct:asyncDIT}

	\subsection{Definition}

		In an asynchronous system, the first DIT may happen before $O_{max}$, i.e. before all tasks are in the system. We thus introduce the following notion:

		\begin{definition}
			The \textbf{first periodic DIT} (FPDIT) of a system is the earliest DIT occurring
			strictly after $O_{max}$.
		\end{definition}

		By a slight abuse of notation, it will also be noted $t_d$. Note that in the
		synchronous case the first periodic DIT is also the first DIT.

	\subsection{Existence condition}
  \label{sct:FPDITexist}
		As in the synchronous case, the problem of existence of the FPDIT
		can be written as a system of modular equations:
		\[
			\begin{array}{l}
				\exists ? \; t_d \; s.t. \; \forall i \; :\\
				\left\{
					\begin{array}{l}
						t_d > O_i \\
						t_d - O_i \equiv a_i \; (mod \; T_i) \\
						a_i \in [D_i, T_i]
					\end{array}
				\right.
			\end{array}
		\]

		This system is guaranteed to have at least one solution modulo $H$ for given
		values of $a_i$ if the following condition is respected:
		\[
			a_i + O_i \equiv a_j + O_j \; (\operatorname{mod} \; \operatorname{gcd}(T_i,
			T_j)) \; \forall i,j
		\]
		which means that there could be systems with no FPDIT.
		We now present an example of such a system.\\

		\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|c|}
		 \hline
		  & $O_i$ & $C_i$ & $D_i$ & $T_i$ \\
		 \hline
		 $\tau_1$ & 0 & $C_1$ & 3 & 4\\
		 \hline
		 $\tau_2$ & 2 & $C_2$ & 7 & 8\\
		 \hline
		\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		~\\

		Here, the possible values of $a_1$ are 3 and 4, and the possible values
		of $a_2$ are 7 and 8. For a FPDIT to exist, one of those
		condition must be fulfilled:
		\[
		\left[
		\begin{array}{c}
			3 + 0 \equiv 7 + 2 \; (\operatorname{mod} \; 4 ) \\
			3 + 0 \equiv 8 + 2 \; (\operatorname{mod} \; 4 ) \\
			4 + 0 \equiv 7 + 2 \; (\operatorname{mod} \; 4 ) \\
			4 + 0 \equiv 8 + 2 \; (\operatorname{mod} \; 4 ) \\
		\end{array}
		\right.
		\]
		However those four conditions are false, so the system has no FPDIT
		(and no other DIT than $t=0$).

	\subsection{Simulation}

	We wanted to quantify how much systems have a FPDIT........

	We generated task systems by
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Generating utilization values with the \texttt{UUniFast} algorithm described in \cite{bini2005measuring}, with parameters
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $U_{tot}$ (system utilization) chosen uniformly between 0.25 and 0.75
			\item $n$ (number of tasks) equal to 3
		\end{itemize}
		\item Choosing the $T_i$ uniformly between 5 and 20, which also gives us the $C_i = \lfloor U_i \, T_i \rfloor$
		\item Choosing the $O_i$ with a normal distribution of mean $T_{min}$ and standard deviation $\frac{T_{max} - T_{min}}{2}$
		\item Choosing the $D_i$ uniformly in the interval $[T_i - \frac{T_i - C_i}{CDF}, T_i]$, where the $CDF$ is called \emph{Constrained Deadline Factor}.
	\end{itemize}
	and then computed the value of the FPDIT.\\

	We use the CDF because........\\

	\caption{Evolution of the existence of FPDIT with the CDF}
	\label{fig:noFPDIT}
	\end{figure}

	The result are represented in Fig. \ref{fig:noFPDIT}. We observe that the more we are close to the implicit deadline case, the less systems have FPDIT.

\section{C-space of asynchronous systems}
  \label{sct:asyncCspace}

  \subsection{Description using DBF}

  The description we presented in Section \ref{sct:cspaceDescr} was general, and is thus still relevant. Therefore the C-space is still described by the following infinite number of constraints:$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} n_i(t_1, t_2) \, C_i \leq t_2 - t_1 \; \forall \: 0 \leq t_1 \leq t_2$$

  However, the method used in the synchronous case to remove redundancy does not apply here. A more general approach is presented in the following section.

  \subsection{Removing redundancy}

\subsubsection{Job arrival and deadline}

Consider an interval $[t_1, t_2]$. If $t_2$ is an instant without any job deadline, then by definition the value of $\dbf{t_1, t_2}$ will be equal to $\dbf{t_1, t_2^*}$, where $t_2^*$ is the latest deadline before $t_2$.\\

A similar argument can be made if $t_1$ is an instant without any job arrival (and $t_1^*$ is the earliest arrival after $t_1$). We can thus restricts ourselves to intervals where $t_1$ is an instant with at least one job arrival, and $t_2$ is an instant with at least one job deadline.

  \subsubsection{Feasibility interval}

  First let us recall how an asynchronous system behaves under an optimal scheduler, for example EDF.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
	\[
		\begin{array}{r||c|c|c|l}
			& \text{Incomplete} & \text{Transitive} & \text{Stationary} & \cdots \\
			\text{Name} & \text{period} & \text{period} & \text{period}  & \\
			\hline
			\text{size} & O_{max} & H & H & \cdots \\
			\hline
			t \geqslant & 0 & O_{max} & O_{max} + H & \cdots
		\end{array}
	\]
	\begin{center}
	\caption{Behavior of an asynchronous system under EDF.}
	\label{fig:asyncBehavior}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:asyncBehavior}, the system begins in the \emph{incomplete period}, where all tasks are not in the system. Then, after $O_{max}$ time units, every tasks is in the system and the \emph{transitive period} begins. Then, after $O_{max} + H$ time units, the system is faced with the same pattern of arrival as in $O_{max}$. However, because in $O_{max} + H$ every task is in the system and in $O_{max}$ some were missing, the state of the system will be different. The \emph{stationary period} then begins. It is only after $O_{max} + 2H$ time units that the system comes back into a state in which we can be sure it has been before.\\

For this reason, as explained in \cite{leung1982complexity}, it is sufficient to check for intervals included in the interval $[O_{max}, O_{max} + 2H]$, which has an exponential length in the number of tasks.

\subsubsection{Using the first periodic DIT}

The first periodic DIT, if it exists, must occur in the transitive period. Indeed, it cannot occur in the incomplete period by definition ($t_d > O_{max}$) and if it occurred in the $k^{th}$ stationary period, another DIT should have occurred in the transitive period at instant $t_d - k H$ (a contradiction).\\

We show (???) that we can restrict the DBF test to intervals included in the interval $[t_d, t_d + H]$, if the first periodic DIT exists. This will always be a better interval than $[O_{max}, O_{max} + 2H]$ and if the first periodic DIT does not exist (which can be verified as explained in Section \ref{sct:FPDITexist}), the latter interval can be used.\\

\subsubsection{Redundancy as an integer linear problem}

The general problem of redundancy of a new linear constraint $C \, X \leq d$ w.r.t. a set of previous linear constraints $A \, X \leq B$ in an ILP can itself be written as the following ILP:

\begin{figure}[h]
$$z = \max C \, X$$
s.t.
\[
\begin{array}{rccc}
	A & X &\leq & B \\
	C & X &\leq & d + 1
\end{array}
\]
with
\[
	\begin{array}{ccc}
		A & : & [k,n] \text{ matrix}\\
		B & : & [1,n] \text{ matrix}\\
		C & : & [k,1] \text{ matrix}\\
		X & : & [1,n] \text{ matrix}\\
		d & : & \text{integer}
	\end{array}
\]
\caption{Redundancy of $CX \leq d$ w.r.t. $A X \leq B$ as a ILP}
\end{figure}

Indeed, if the maximization returns $z=d+1$, it means that there are some integer values accessible with the previous constraints that the new constraint forbids. On the other hands, if the maximization returns $z \leq d$, it means that the limitation expressed in the new constraint is already enforced by the previous constraints. Therefore $z \leq d$ is a necessary and sufficient condition of redundancy of the new constraint.\\

Such a linear problem can be solved by the simplex algorithm. However, here the problem is not exactly the same as we have a set of constraints and we want to find all redundant constraints within. The naive method would be to directly test each constraints of the set against all the others, we present a similar method with an efficient preprocessing in Algorithm \ref{alg:prunRedun}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Removing redundancy from CSPACE}
\label{alg:prunRedun}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\STATE $CSPACE$ : set of constraints
		\STATE $S \leftarrow \emptyset$
		\STATE \COMMENT{First pass - test $cstr$ against previous ones}
		\FOR{$cstr$ \textbf{in} $CSPACE$}
			\IF {$cstr$ is not redundant w.r.t. $S$}
				\STATE $S \leftarrow cstr$
			\ENDIF
		\ENDFOR
		\STATE \COMMENT{Second pass - test $cstr$ against every other}
		\FOR{$cstr$ \textbf{in} $S$}
			\STATE Remove $cstr$ from $S$
			\IF {$cstr$ is not redundant w.r.t. $S$}
				\STATE Put $cstr$ back into $S$
			\ENDIF
		\ENDFOR
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

After doing this, no redundant constraints are left. However, this algorithm takes an exponential time in the number of constraints. An efficient initial description of $CSPACE$, as described in previous sections, is therefore preferred.\\

To summarize, we first reduced the number of constraint from every possible interval $[t_1, t_2]$ to only the interval where $t_1$ is an arrival and $t_2$ is a deadline between $[t_d, t_d + H]$ if $t_d$ exists, or between $[O_{max}, O_{max} + 2H]$ otherwise. After this correct but not efficient description of the C-SPACE, a linear integer approach removes the remaining redundancies.
